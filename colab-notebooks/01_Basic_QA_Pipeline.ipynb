        "> We've modified this first tutorial to make it simpler to start with. If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",

        "- **Nodes Used**: `InMemoryDocumentStore`, `BM25Retriever`, `FARMReader`\n",
        "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

        "Learn how to build a question answering system using Haystack's DocumentStore, Retriever, and Reader. Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help you get started quicker, we simplified certain steps in this tutorial. For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry! This doesn't affect how well the question answering system performs."

Following his expansion of the series, Martin eventually concluded it would be succeeded by one final novel, ''A Dream of Spring''. By June 2010, Martin had finished four chapters for ''The Winds of Winter'' from the viewpoints of Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, and Arianne Martell. In July 2010, he added an Aeron Greyjoy chapter that had been moved from ''A Dance with Dragons'' to ''The Winds of Winter'', accumulating around 100 completed manuscript pages. Following the publication of ''A Dance with Dragons'' in the summer of 2011, Martin announced his return to writing  the series in January 2012, having spent the intervening time on his U.S. and overseas book publicity tours and attending various conventions. He continued to work, with his two co-authors Elio García and Linda Antonsson, on the illustrated series companion guide ''The World of Ice & Fire'' concordance and Westeros history.

The warp yarns are 2/30NE Cotton in black and white end-on-end, and the weft yarns are 1/10NM Flax and Linen.\\n\\nThe construction of the fabric are combinations of double-cloth and double-faced satins and sateen structures over 4 ends.

They then manually swap between colour palette during the weaving process.\\n\\nThe weave has 84 threads per cm in the weft, and to ensure the scale is kept true to the designs the artwork then needs to be stretched and rotated.

Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of ''The Twilight Zone'' throughout 1986 and on ''Beauty and the Beast'' until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where he did not have to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.\\n\\nWhen Martin was between Hollywood projects in the summer of 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called ''Avalon''. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 6}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '20a622e0e5d75856d0b55662e0371f66'}>,\n",

A long prologue was to establish what had happened in the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot.

Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's ''Iliad'', where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, as an example of what he wants to achieve with his books.\\n\\nMartin is widely credited with broadening the fantasy fiction genre for adult content, including incest, paedophilia, and adultery.
